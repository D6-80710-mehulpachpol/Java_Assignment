//1. Create an abstract class BoundedShape with fields x, y. Provide abstract method calcArea(). Inherit it into a Circle class with additional fields radius and
//override calcArea() method. Inherit BoundedShape into another abstract class Polygon with additional field number of sides. Inherit BoundedShape into
//classes Triangle (fields: side1, side2, side3), Square (fields: side), and Rectangle (fields: length, breadth). Override calcArea() method in them.
